# Early-Disease-Detection
A Machine Learning Project on Early Disease Detection and its type.
Welcome to the Early Disease Detection project! This repository contains a machine learning pipeline for predicting the risk of various diseases based on health and lifestyle data. The goal is to provide a tool for early diagnosis and preventive healthcare, leveraging data-driven insights.
Introduction
This project utilizes machine learning models to predict the likelihood of diseases such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and more, using demographic, lifestyle, and clinical data. The aim is to assist healthcare professionals and individuals in identifying health risks early, enabling timely intervention and better health outcomes.

# Features
Predicts risk for multiple diseases based on user data
Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Model training, evaluation, and reporting
Visualizations for data exploration and results
Modular and easy-to-extend codebase

# Technologies Used
Python (Jupyter Notebook)
Pandas, NumPy (data manipulation)
Seaborn, Matplotlib (visualization)
scikit-learn (machine learning)
StandardScaler, LabelEncoder (preprocessing)
